# Upgradeable contracts

original method

- Create & deploy a new version of the contract.
- Manually migrate all states from the old contract to the new contract.
  this is expensive, contract address is being changed whenever deploy, we should ask users to use new contract

we can use Proxy contract with an interface where each method delegates to the `implementation` contract containing logic
