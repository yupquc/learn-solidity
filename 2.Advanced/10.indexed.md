# What's "indexed" keyword in a event?. How many can you mark as indexed?

- off-chain side, we can filter events by name and by contract address.
- up to 3 indexed
- blockchain keeps event params in transaction logs in two parts - data and topics (indexed will be stored on topics)
- indexed params will allow users to search for these events using the indexed parameters as filter
- not indexed attributes are ABI-encoded into the data portion of the transaction log
